                                are made from a variety of leathers and textiles, there’s no one-size-fits-all care
                                method. Different shoes have different care needs, so to find out how your pair are best

                            <p class="faq-panel" style="margin-top: 1.25em; margin-bottom: 2.5em">Leather shoes can be
                                particularly prone to scuffing if they come into contact with an abrasive surface. A
                                natural shoe polish such as beeswax can be used to keep leather soft and protected to
                                prevent scuffing and can also be used to reduce the appearance of light scuff marks and
                                rejuvenate the overall appearance of leather. A colour-matched polish can be used to
                                mask more prominent scuff marks. If you find your child’s shoes are showing excessive
                                scuffing, this could be because they’re in shoes that aren’t suitable to their stage of
                                development or their shoes don’t fit them correctly. If your child’s shoes are too big
                                for them, the shoes are more likely to drag on the ground and cause your child to trip
                                up. Refer to FAQ sections Ranges and Sizing to find out how you can make sure your child
                                is in the best shoes for their feet. To find out more about how to look after your Bobux
                                shoes, please refer to our <a href="shoe-care">Care Instructions guide</a>. </p>
